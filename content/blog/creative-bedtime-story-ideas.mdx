## Pro Tips for Telling These Stories

### 1. **Start Strong, End Soft**

Begin with a normal speaking voice and gradually get quieter and slower as the story progresses. By the end, you should be almost whispering.

### 2. **Use Repetition**

Kids find repetition soothing. Use phrases like "and they felt more and more sleepy" or "everything was peaceful and calm" multiple times.

### 3. **Incorporate Sensory Details**

Describe how things feel (soft, warm, cozy), sound (gentle, quiet, peaceful), and look (dim, glowing, peaceful). Sensory details make stories more immersive and calming.

### 4. **Make It Personal**

Insert your child's name, their favorite color, their stuffed animal's name, or their actual experiences. Personal details increase engagement.

### 5. **Keep It Positive**

Avoid conflict, scary elements, or exciting plot twists. The goal is calm, not stimulation.

### 6. **Have a Consistent Ending**

End every story the same way: "And [Child's Name] fell asleep, safe and happy, and had the most wonderful dreams." This creates a powerful sleep association.
